# Update

* 2018.12.12: Release Pytorch-version BSN
* 2018.09.26: Previously, we adopted classification results from result files of "Uts at activitynet 2016" for action detection experiments. Recently we found that the classification accuracy of these results are unexpected high. Thus we replace it with classification results of "cuhk & ethz & siat submission to activitynet challenge 2017" and updated all related experiments accordingly. You can find updated papers in my [homepage](wzmsltw.github.io) and in arXiv.
* 2018.07.09: Codes and feature of BSN
* 2018.07.02: Repository for BSN

# Paper Introduction

Temporal action proposal generation is an important yet challenging problem, since temporal proposals with rich action content are indispensable for analysing real-world videos with long duration and high proportion irrelevant content. This problem requires methods not only generating proposals with precise temporal boundaries, but also retrieving proposals to cover truth action instances with high recall and high overlap using relatively fewer proposals. To address these difficulties, we introduce an effective proposal generation method, named Boundary-Sensitive Network (BSN), which adopts “local to global” fashion. Locally, BSN first locates temporal boundaries with high probabilities, then directly combines these boundaries as proposals. Globally, with Boundary-Sensitive Proposal feature, BSN retrieves proposals by evaluating the confidence of whether a proposal contains an action within its region. We conduct experiments on two challenging datasets: ActivityNet-1.3 and THUMOS14, where BSN outperforms other state-of-the-art temporal action proposal generation methods with high recall and high temporal precision. Finally, further experiments demonstrate that by combining existing action classifiers, our method significantly improves the state-of-the-art temporal action detection performance.


# Prerequisites

These code is  implemented in Tensorflow (>1.0). Thus please install tensorflow first.

To  accelerate the training speed, all input feature data are loaded in RAM first. Thus around 7GB RAM is required.


# Code and Data Preparation

## Get the code

Clone this repo with git, please use:

```
git clone https://github.com/wzmsltw/BSN-boundary-sensitive-network.git
```


## Download Datasets

We support experiments with publicly available dataset ActivityNet 1.3 for temporal action proposal generation now. To download this dataset, please use [official ActivityNet downloader](https://github.com/activitynet/ActivityNet/tree/master/Crawler) to download videos from the YouTube.

To extract visual feature, we adopt TSN model pretrained on the training set of ActivityNet, which is the challenge solution of CUHK&ETH&SIAT team in ActivityNet challenge 2016. Please refer this repo [TSN-yjxiong](https://github.com/yjxiong/temporal-segment-networks) to extract frames and optical flow and refer this repo [anet2016-cuhk](https://github.com/yjxiong/anet2016-cuhk) to find pretrained TSN model.

For convenience of training and testing, we rescale the feature length of all videos to same length 100, and we provide the rescaled feature at here [Google Cloud](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ISemndlSDS2FtqQOKL0t3Cjj9yk2yznF/view?usp=sharing) or [Baidu Yun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/19GI3_-uZbd_XynUO6g-8YQ). If you download features from BaiduYun, please use `cat zip_csv_mean_100.z* > csv_mean_100.zip` before unzip. After download and unzip, please put `csv_mean_100` directory to `./data/activitynet_feature_cuhk/` .
